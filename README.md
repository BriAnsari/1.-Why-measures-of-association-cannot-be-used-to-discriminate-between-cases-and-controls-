### This report summarizes the paper “Limitations of the Odds Ratio in Gauging the Performance of a Diagnostic, Prognostic, or Screening Marker” by Pepe et al, 2003. The report also includes my perspective based on literature review and the course material for “Risk prediction and Precision Medicine”. A glossary for special terminologies* can be found at the end of the report for reference.
